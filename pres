how to make a (semi-)professional platformer

this series will cover my
* thought process
* development process
* artistic process (to an extent)

step 1

prototype

@love.png

lua + love2d
* fast (development)
* flexible
* safe

step 2

implement engine

(according to prototype)

C + Compatability Layer

C
* wicked fast
* clean
* simple to use ABI (external scripting?)
* portable

compatability layer
* 'cause i don't want to write win32 crap
* 'cause X kinda blows
* 'cause ObjC is terrible (and Swift isn't that much better)

now you've finished 80% of the work

step 3

polish game/engine

this is the final 80% of work

polish gives a game that
JE NE SE QUOS
that makes it fun to play

the funness factor is also influenced by the underlying mechanics

but it's heavily affected by the polish

then

ITS PARTY TIME

release game on itch.io or something...

\

time for the first part

develop a protoype platformer in Love2D
